Sprint 2:

- When running the app, ensure you're in the ../code directory, and run:
    python3 backend/app.py 

    (this will ensure that all the page routing functions properly, can be chanegd later)

- To quickly view the database of users, just go to the /admin/users extension in the web bar

*****
- Notes on how to implement matching.py:

import statement:
    from matching import compatibility_score, rank_candidates

1. compatibility_score(me, other)
    → Returns an int (0–100) score between two profiles.

2. rank_candidates(me, candidates, top_k=None)
    → Returns a sorted list:
    
        [
        {"profile": <candidate_dict>, "score": <int>},
        ...
        ]
    
    Highest scores come first.

Expected profile strcuture:

    {
    "user_id": 1,
    "username": "alex",
    "budget": "850",
    "location": "Seattle",
    "lifestyle": "early sleeper"
    }
